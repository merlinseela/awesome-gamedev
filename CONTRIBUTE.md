# Contribution Guidelines Awesome Gamedev

The following rules and styles should apply if you want your commit to be accepted to the list!

1. Each list entry must be unique! If an Application, Website, ... could fit multiple sections, then open an issue and wait for feedback/discussion.
2. Each list is to be sorted alphabetically and ascending!
3. An entry must be put to the end of the list if it has one of the following additions:

> [!NOTE]
> ...

> [!TIP]
> ...

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ...

> [!WARNING]
> ...

> [!CAUTION]
> ...

4. If there are multiple entries with additions then the following applies:
    1. Sort by Addition-Type as seen in 3.
    2. If 2 entries have the same addition then sort by name of entry alphabetically and ascending!
